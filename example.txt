AWESOME COBOL ADDRESS BOOK
==========================

This file is meant to be read by humans
and to be easy to parse by COBOL programs
as it's fixed width based, i.e. all elements
are positioned at the same places in the file
with regards to their relative row/column offset.

The exact row/column offsets have unfortunately
been forgotten, but should be trivial for any
humans to manually derive, or write some kind
of AI to automatically do the tedious job.

Foo Bar             +46701234567   
foo.bar@gmail.com             

John Doe            +150512345678  
cooldude@mail.com             

Foo Bar             +3581293773    
foo.bar@hotmail.com           

The actual data might be spread out in the file,
and have various headers, footers and crap in between
different sections.

So if we add some more entires below, they must also be found.
